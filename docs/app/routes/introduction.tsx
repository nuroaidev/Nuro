        <h2 id="what">What is Nuro</h2>
        <p>
          Nuro runs large language models across many machines that nobody
          centrally owns. A model too big for any single GPU is split into
          contiguous layer blocks, and each machine in the swarm runs only its
          block. Activations stream from one node to the next over a sealed
          wire until a token comes out the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          That much - fast, correct, decentralized inference over the open
          internet - was already proven by prior work (<strong>Shard</strong>).
          Nuro inherits it and takes on the problem Shard left open:{" "}
          <strong>
            a node that runs your layer must decrypt to compute, so it sees the
            activations it processes and can reconstruct a large fraction of
            your prompt.
          </strong>{" "}
          Nuro turns that leak into a measured number, drives it down by
          construction, and puts it in a receipt.
        </p>

        <Figure caption="A prompt is embedded on a trusted head, streamed through untrusted worker blocks, and finalized on a trusted tail - no node holds the whole model.">

        <h2 id="thesis">The one-line thesis</h2>
        <Callout tone="info" title="Thesis">
          Shard proved a frontier model can be served across machines nobody
          owns, fast and correctly, with a receipt a skeptic can check. It also
          showed a node running your layer can reconstruct a large fraction of
          your tokens. <strong>Nuro's job is to turn that leak into a number,
          drive the number down by construction, and put it in a receipt.</strong>{" "}
          Privacy earns its word phase by phase, never on day one.
        </Callout>

        <h2 id="why">Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
          Every hosted AI provider asks you to trust a promise: that they will
          not log, train on, or hand over your prompts. Decentralizing the
          compute does not automatically fix this - it can make it worse,
          because now strangers run your layers. The industry answer so far has
          been the word "private" with nothing measurable behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nuro treats privacy the way good systems treat correctness: as a{" "}
          <strong>measured, adversarial, per-run property</strong> with a
          reproducible number, not a marketing claim.

            A reconstruction adversary measures how much of your prompt an
            untrusted node can recover. Defenses drive that number below a

            Inference is sharded across contributed GPUs over the open internet.

            No policy gate sits between you and the model. You are billed in a

            Both correctness and privacy ship as receipts a third party can
